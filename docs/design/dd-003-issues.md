This document describes the design of the [issues](
https://github.com/rbmk-project/issues) repository, which
contains the issue tracker for the [rbmk project](
https://github.com/rbmk-project).

The general idea is that we will have several repositories
containing code, and we want to have a single place where
to collect issues, rather than having them scattered across
several repositories.
