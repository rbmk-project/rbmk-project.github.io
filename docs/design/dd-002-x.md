This document describes the design of the [x](
https://github.com/rbmk-project/x) library collection,
which contains several experimental libraries reused across
[rbmk](https://github.com/rbmk-project) repositories.

The [x](https://github.com/rbmk-project/x) collection and
repository will never be stable and will never be tagged. It
is a place for experimentation, and may contained unstable,
untested, obsolete, or broken code.

When a library added to [x](https://github.com/rbmk-project/x)
matures, we will copy it either to [common](https://github.com/rbmk-project/common)
or to a library specific repository. When this happens, we will
mark the copy of the library living inside the `x` collection
as deprecated. We will try to keep the old code around, to document
its history, but we may eventually delete old libraries.
