This document describes the design of the [rbmk-project.github.io](
https://github.com/rbmk-project/rbmk-project.github.io) repository, which
contains the public website for the [rbmk project](
https://github.com/rbmk-project).

The general idea is that the website contains also the specifications
and the design documents for the project, in markdown format. We'll take
advantage of GitHub pages automatic rendering of markdown files to
avoid having to maintain two separate repositories for the website and
the technical documentation, with potential for inconsistencies.
