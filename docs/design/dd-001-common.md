This document describes the design of the [common](
https://github.com/rbmk-project/common) library.

We use several general purpose libraries across different
[rbmk](https://github.com/rbmk-project) repositories.

A library added to [common](https://github.com/rbmk-project/common)
should respect these criteria:

1. stable (no breaking changes);

2. well tested and well documented;

3. useful across 3+ repositories.

Otherwise, it is just best to define libraries when they are needed.
